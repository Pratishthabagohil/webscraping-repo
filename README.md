# Web Scraping Flipkart Products Data

## Description
This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract product data from Flipkart's search results for a specific search query. It retrieves basic product information such as product URLs, names, prices, descriptions, and ratings from multiple pages of search results. The project uses Python with libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping.

Additionally, an IPython notebook (`.ipynb`) is included where data science techniques are applied to the scraped data. These techniques include data cleaning, price prediction, outlier removal, and clustering.
